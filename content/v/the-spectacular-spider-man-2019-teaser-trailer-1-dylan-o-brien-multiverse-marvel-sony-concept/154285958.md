Aaccording to a new report, they\u2019ll soon be joined by Morbius, the living vampire, though Tom Holland will not star as Spider-Man, could we see another actor - Dylan O'brien - take on the role as Peter Parker?\n\nSony owns the rights to Spider-Man. That hasn't changed. They created three Spider-Man movies with Sam Raimi, and two with Marc Webb. But after The Amazing Spider-Man 2 met horrible reviews and less-than-expected box office, Marvel struck a deal with Sony to allow them to MAKE a Spider-Man movie, but to let Sony distribute it. Essentially, Spider-Man (recast with Tom Holland) would appear in a story that exists in the MCU plotline. And he'd be available for at least one Avengers film - possibly more. The original agreement between Marvel and Sony included the hero's introductory appearance in Captain America: Civil War, as well as two solo Spider-Man movies - Homecoming, and a sequel dated for 2019 - and an appearance in Avengers: Infinity War.\n\nThat's as far as Marvel's agreement with Sony goes, though Marvel President Kevin Feige has said they are focused on the stories of the moment, and they'd see what makes sense in the future. The party line on the MCU is that after Avengers 4, everything we thought we knew about the MCU will change, so we have no real clue how Spider-Man even fits into those plans long term. In a recent Hollywood Reporter piece, it is being floated that the Spider-Man: Homecoming sequel - arriving July 2019 - will feature a recognizable Marvel hero (though not Iron Man, for a second time). But after that, Spidey's MCU plans are up in the air.\n\nWhere do things stand with Sony? Well, that's where things get very curious. The studio is hoping to reset its plans for building out a Spider-Man universe, as they own the rights to Spidey and his complete Rogues Gallery. Only, up until recently, we didn't know how Spider-Man would be involved. The studio has revealed that it's making a Venom movie, as well as a Black Cat and Silver Sable team up film. The latter movie will star Tom Hardy, and it's now being reported that Carnage will be the villain in the piece. \n\nWe'll be left to wonder just how many times Tom Holland can play Spider-Man in various Marvel and Sony movies before it wears on him. For now, we know that: Marvel and Sony are sharing nicely; Spider-Man will be in two Spidey movies in the MCU, as well as Avengers: Infinity War; and Sony plans to use Holland in their Venom and Black Cat\/Silver Sable films\n\n\u00a9 Sony Pictures\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\u25ba Subscribe to Smasher for ALL NEW Trailers, TV Spots, Exclusive Clips & More from your most anticipated Movies & Shows!
